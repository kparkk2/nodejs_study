    <p>None of the evidence surrounding any of the ¡°rabbit ball¡± conspiracies suggests anything that extreme has ever happened -- especially in the kind of nefarious, purposeful way conspiracy theorists might have you believe. But history shows baseball fans love to speculate and they love to theorize, and people will always manage to see what they want to see, even if there isn¡¯t much to back it up. And considering it¡¯s all harmless, who am I to get in their way? If they want to believe, I say let them believe.</p>
